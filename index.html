        <p>Description of Project 1</p>
        <p> Implementing Firewall using Software Defined Networking (SDN) (MTech. Final
Year Project)</p>
        <p> Project Brief: In large network routing and firewall functions are performed by different
devices but in small network it is not possible. Network administrator cannot modify capabilities
of traditional vendor specific firewalls. But by using capabilities of software defined networking
(SDN) it is possible to modify the firewalls according to our needs. SDN based firewall is
implemented by using POX controller. This Controller is designed to increase the agility of the
network by making it easy to manage and adapt how traffic is handled.</p>

        <p>Description of Project 2</p>
        <p>Wake-Up Band for Safety (B.E Final Year Project)p>
        <p> Project Brief: Monitoring of Bio-vitals has always been a challenging task to the research
community. There are many parameters, which always require constant monitoring like Blood
pressure, Heartrate or pulse, ECG, Body temperature, etc. The blood pressure is a very critical
bio- vital as it is directly related to heart. Hence, in-turn measurement of heart rate is highly
essential. The main cause of accidents is that happened at night because people get tired after
working the whole day and there are chances that the driver may fell a bit drowsy or fall asleep
while driving. The main task is to collect a driver's physiological data by the bio-sensor and
analyze the measured data to find the key parameters related to the drowsiness. Design a
drowsiness detection algorithm and develop a mobile app to alert tired drivers. The results from
this project can lead to the development of real products, which can save many lives and avoid
many accidents on the road</p>
